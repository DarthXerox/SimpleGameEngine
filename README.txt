Forest

Hello,
this is a simple 3D game set on a grassy field with trees - in a forest.
The goal is to collect 5 floating stones scattered around the map
(for simplicity I put 4 of the stones in the map's corners and the fifth at its middle)

Out of the necessary conditions my game implements: fog, cone light, procedurally generated map, GUI, normal mapping and maybe sounds
The game is implemented in standard .NET C# 4.7.1 and uses (should be in the packages folder, but just to be sure) these  dlls/nuget packages: 
OpenTK 3.2.0
AssimpNet 4.1.0
SharpFont.Dependencies 2.6.0
SharpFont 4.0.1
